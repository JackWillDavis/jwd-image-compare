# \<jwd-img-compare\>

An image comparison webcomponent

Inspired by the image slider elements on [YNAB Method](https://www.youneedabudget.com/method/), this webcomponent accepts two image URLs which can be compared with an adjustable slider.

Applications could be for comparing image filters, image quality, differing scenarios or before & after pictures.
